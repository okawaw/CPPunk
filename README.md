CPPunk
======

CPPunk is a free C++ library designed for developing 2D graphical applications. It is modeled after the FlashPunk library by Chevy Ray Johnston.

CPPunk comes with support for graphical display, keyboard input, mouse input, and sound playback.

The default implementation that is provided uses SDL and requires installation of SDL, SDL_Image, and SDL_Mixer. However, if SDL does not fit your needs, your own implementations to the provided interfaces can be used.
